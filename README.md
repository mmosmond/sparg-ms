# sparg-ms
Code for "Estimating dispersal rates and locating genetic ancestors with genome-wide genealogies" by Osmond &amp; Coop.

The code to create the data and make the plots is in simulations/ and athaliana/. We do not include the data here and instead just include the final plots in manuscript/. While the code documents our entire pipeline (thank-you Snakemake!), it will take some finagling to run (we hope to remedy this one day). 

See https://github.com/mmosmond/sparg for the most up to date version of the Python package, 'sparg'.

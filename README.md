# sparg-ms
Code for "Estimating dispersal rates and locating genetic ancestors with genome-wide genealogies" by Matt Osmond &amp; Graham Coop.

The code to create the data and make the plots is in simulations/ and athaliana/. We do not include the intermediate data here and instead just include the final plots in manuscript/plots/. While the code documents our entire pipeline (thank-you Snakemake!), it will take some finagling to run elsewhere (we hope to remedy this one day). 

See https://github.com/mmosmond/sparg for the most up to date version of the Python package, ```sparg```.

See https://youtu.be/4itER1uEKbQ for a goofy video abstract.
